SETUP:

I strongly suggest using rvm (http://beginrescueend.com) to handle setting up and installing ruby.
If you do, you will be able to install gems without using sudo.  If you insist on using the 
system ruby, it may be necessary to use sudo to install some dependencies.

* install bundler [ gem install bundler ]
* use bundler to install required gems [ bundle install ]
* start up the kohana server [ rake up ]
        The first time you run this, it may take some time as it will need to download the correct base
        image box and provision it.  You will also need to have network access during the provisioning process as it
        needs to download and install several packages for the demo server to install properly.

DESCRIPTION:

There are four types of testing demonstrated in this presentation:

1. Web UI in browser testing
2. Unit/Functional testing with Cuke4php
3. Remote UI testing augmented with cuke4php
4. Code Coverage
